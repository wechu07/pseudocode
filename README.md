# alx printf project

## basic knowledge or requirements
- loops in c
- knowledge of printf format specifiers
- variadic functions and how they are used
- switch in c

## files you may want to implement (we will figure out)
- the _printf.c file

## files you may want to implement (we will figure out)
- using putchar to print a character as we go

## implementation steps
### step1.c file
- first of all prepare the test files. In this case it is the `main.c` file, in my case I have included it in the _printf.c file
- we then test with output characters first
    - here we use a state variable that determine if a character should be printed or not
    - the output should be 
    '''
    Print a character: GPrint a string: Print a postive integer: Print a negative integer: Print a (zero) integer: Print a hexademical: Print a zero hexademical: Print a pointer:
    '''
### step2.c file: implementing character being printed out
